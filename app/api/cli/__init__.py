NOTE:
TODO:
This module contains all CLI commands that you can use to test the app locally without having to use postgres.
We will make it easy to define your own containers for dependency injection so you can use a local version of the
app without having to define a database or anything else.
We will also develop a local version of chatApp system that will be based on a user profile setting JSON ?
We will make sure that the response from this are correctly mock based on a provided JSON file at the start of the CLI
