# TODO: This services will be in charge to determine which use cases will be used.
# Depending on the message sender, the state of the user profile we will run a different user case.\
# For example, new message and the nb of participant in the conversation is more than 2, then the bot should respond only if it was tagged.
# We will have a specific use case to handle depending on different data (we could have different use case based on the channel type)


# Then the service will be in charge of applying changes to the database based on the output.
